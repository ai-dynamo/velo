# Coding gotchas

Each entry is a lesson from a race or a flaky test: the rule, the failure it
prevents, how to test for it, and one test that shows it. Read this chapter
before you write, review, or test code here.

## Two counts dropped on two threads: compare them under a lock

**Rule.** When two threads each drop one of two counters, and the last one to reach 0 must act, do not decrement your counter and then load the other one. Either check both counts under a lock that orders the two checks, or make all four operations `SeqCst`. The shutdown gate uses `SeqCst` for this reason ([Shutdown and drain](../concepts/shutdown.md)).

Decrement-then-load is the store-buffer pattern. On a weakly ordered CPU each thread can read the other's old value, so neither acts.

**Failure.** A rendezvous slot is freed when its reference count and its read-lock count are both 0. The owner drops the reference on one thread, and the last reader drops its read lock on another. With decrement-then-load, neither side freed the slot, and it stayed for the life of the process. The rule in `DataStore::end_lease` now is: whichever call takes a count to 0 calls `try_free`. Each count changes under a read guard on the slot's `DashMap` shard, and `try_free` checks both counts under that shard's write lock. So the later of the two `try_free` calls sees both zeros.

**Test.** Start both sides on a `Barrier` and repeat a few thousand times in one test, then run that test 50 times. On an aarch64 host the test below failed 2 of 21 runs with decrement-then-load, and passed 50 of 50 with the shard-lock rule.

Test: `rendezvous::reclaim_tests::an_owner_and_its_last_reader_leaving_together_free_the_slot`
(`lib/velo/src/rendezvous/reclaim_tests.rs`).

## A test cannot force a tokio scheduling outcome by arranging wakes

**Rule.** Do not assert a tokio scheduling outcome that the test arranges with wakes, such as a stall behind the LIFO slot or a task that runs on a given worker. Assert the workaround or the invariant instead.

Another wake can reach the task first: a heartbeat, a credit reply, or a timer. If the task's poll is still running at that time, tokio only marks the task notified, and the task then runs on another worker.

**Failure.** A test that asserts the stall passes hundreds of times and still fails on a loaded CI runner.

**Test.** Force the other interleaving: pause threads under a debugger, or add a concurrent wake. Then see whether the assertion still holds. Keep a demonstration of the stall as an ignored test.

Test: `block_in_place_keeps_the_stream` is the live test of the workaround, and `a_held_worker_thread_cuts_the_stream` is the ignored demonstration of the stall (`lib/velo/tests/streaming/held_thread.rs`).
