# Coding gotchas

Each entry is a lesson from a race or a flaky test: the rule, the failure it
prevents, how to test for it, and one test that shows it. Read this chapter
before you write, review, or test code here.

## Two counts dropped on two threads: compare them under a lock

**Rule.** When two threads each drop one of two counters, and the last one to reach 0 must act, do not decrement your counter and then load the other one. Either check both counts under a lock that orders the two checks, or make all four operations `SeqCst`. The shutdown gate uses `SeqCst` for this reason ([Shutdown and drain](../concepts/shutdown.md)).

Decrement-then-load is the store-buffer pattern. On a weakly ordered CPU each thread can read the other's old value, so neither acts.

**Failure.** A rendezvous slot is freed when its reference count and its read-lock count are both 0. The owner drops the reference on one thread, and the last reader drops its read lock on another. With decrement-then-load, neither side freed the slot, and it stayed for the life of the process. The rule in `DataStore::end_lease` now is: whichever call takes a count to 0 calls `try_free`. Each count changes under a read guard on the slot's `DashMap` shard, and `try_free` checks both counts under that shard's write lock. So the later of the two `try_free` calls sees both zeros.

**Test.** Start both sides on a `Barrier` and repeat a few thousand times in one test, then run that test 50 times. On an aarch64 host the test below failed 2 of 21 runs with decrement-then-load, and passed 50 of 50 with the shard-lock rule.

Test: `rendezvous::reclaim_tests::an_owner_and_its_last_reader_leaving_together_free_the_slot`
(`lib/velo/src/rendezvous/reclaim_tests.rs`).

## A test cannot force a tokio scheduling outcome by arranging wakes

**Rule.** Do not assert a tokio scheduling outcome that the test arranges with wakes, such as a stall behind the LIFO slot or a task that runs on a given worker. Assert the workaround or the invariant instead.

Another wake can reach the task first: a heartbeat, a credit reply, or a timer. If the task's poll is still running at that time, tokio only marks the task notified, and the task then runs on another worker.

**Failure.** A test that asserts the stall passes hundreds of times and still fails on a loaded CI runner.

**Test.** Force the other interleaving: pause threads under a debugger, or add a concurrent wake. Then see whether the assertion still holds. Keep a demonstration of the stall as an ignored test.

Test: `block_in_place_keeps_the_stream` is the live test of the workaround, and `a_held_worker_thread_cuts_the_stream` is the ignored demonstration of the stall (`lib/velo/tests/streaming/held_thread.rs`).

## A cancel wakes child tokens before the parent's own waiters

**Rule.** A task on a child token wakes before a task on the parent token.
When you move a task to a child token, check what other tasks stop on the same
cancel, and keep the wake order they had. If one task must wake before another,
put the second one on a child of the first one's token.

`CancellationToken::cancel` (tokio-util 0.7) wakes the waiters of each child
token before the waiters of the token itself. It moves a child's own children
up and wakes them after that child. A child token per connection removes a
lock that all connections share from the per-frame poll, so this comes up each
time a loop moves to a child token.

A wake order is not a run order. On a current-thread runtime, tasks run in the
order they woke. On a multi-thread runtime, a task that woke second can run
first. When the order must hold there too, make the second task wait for the
first one, for example on a token that the first one cancels when it is done.

**Failure.** The QUIC listener's stream readers wait on a child token. As
children of the node-wide teardown token, they woke before the connection
task. A reader dropped its stream first, and the peer got a STOP_SENDING
instead of the connection close. The dialer reads that as frames left unread,
and warns on every peer restart. The readers' tokens are now children of the
connection task's token, so the connection task wakes first, as it did when
all of them waited on the node-wide token. On a multi-thread runtime a reader
can still run first, then and now: this keeps the old order, and does not make
it certain.

**Test.** Use a current-thread runtime, where the wake order is the run
order. Hold the cancel at the point between the two wakes: build your own child token before
the code under test starts, so the cancel reaches it last, and poll it with a
waker that blocks until the test releases it. Then check what the peer sees
while the cancel is held.

Test: `transports::quic::transport::tests::teardown_closes_the_connection_before_child_readers_stop_streams`
(`lib/velo/src/transports/quic/tests.rs`).
