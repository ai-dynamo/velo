# velo-messenger

Active messaging layer for Velo distributed systems. Sits between `` (transport abstraction) and higher-level session/service crates, providing request-response and fire-and-forget messaging patterns over pluggable transports.

## Architecture

```text
velo-common  →    →  velo-messenger  →  (higher-level crates)
  (types)       (transports)     (messaging)
```

`Messenger` is the central type. It owns a `::VeloBackend`, wires up inbound message dispatch, and exposes a builder-based API for both registering handlers and sending messages.

### Modules

```
src/
  messenger.rs       Messenger + MessengerBuilder
  discovery.rs       PeerDiscovery trait
  client/            ActiveMessageClient, send/unary/typed-unary builders
  handlers/          Handler definitions, builder API, dispatch adapters
  server/            Inbound message dispatch, system handlers (_hello, _list_handlers)
  events/            Distributed event system (remote subscribe/trigger/poison over AM)
  common/            Wire format (MessageId, encoding, ResponseManager)
```

## Messaging Patterns

**Fire-and-forget** -- send a message with no response expected:
```rust
messenger.am_send("notify")?.payload(&data)?.instance(peer).send().await?;
```

All four patterns are async. For fire-and-forget, the future completes once the message has been issued to the transport -- delivery is best-effort with no application-level acknowledgement. While the underlying transport may be reliable (TCP, gRPC, NATS), the sender receives no confirmation that the remote handler processed the message. For the remaining three patterns, the future completes only after the remote handler has finished executing.

**Synchronous (ack/nack)** -- send and wait for the remote handler to complete:
```rust
messenger.am_sync("process")?.payload(&data)?.instance(peer).send().await?;
```

**Unary (request-response)** -- send and receive raw bytes:
```rust
let response: Bytes = messenger.unary("ping")?.raw_payload(Bytes::new()).instance(peer).send().await?;
```

**Typed unary** -- automatic serde serialization:
```rust
let resp: MyResponse = messenger.typed_unary::<MyResponse>("rpc")?.payload(&request)?.instance(peer).send().await?;
```

## Registering Handlers

Handlers are registered on the `Messenger` and dispatched to incoming messages by name. Each handler type has sync and async variants, plus a dispatch mode (`.spawn()` for task isolation, `.inline()` for minimal latency).

```rust
// Sync unary handler
let handler = Handler::unary_handler("ping", |_ctx| Ok(Some(Bytes::new()))).build();
messenger.register_handler(handler)?;

// Async typed handler with automatic deserialization/serialization
let handler = Handler::typed_unary_async("add", |ctx: TypedContext<AddRequest>| async move {
    Ok(AddResponse { sum: ctx.input.a + ctx.input.b })
}).build();
messenger.register_handler(handler)?;
```

Handler context objects (`Context`, `TypedContext`) include a reference to the `Messenger` via `ctx.msg`, allowing handlers to send messages, query peers, or register new handlers.

## Peer Discovery

Discovery is abstracted behind the `PeerDiscovery` trait. Higher-level crates provide implementations (etcd, consul, etc.) without pulling those dependencies into this layer.

```rust
let messenger = Messenger::builder()
    .add_transport(tcp_transport)
    .discovery(my_discovery_impl)
    .build()
    .await?;
```

When no discovery backend is configured, peers must be registered manually via `messenger.register_peer(peer_info)`.

## Distributed Events

The `events` module extends `velo-events` with cross-instance event coordination.
Each `Messenger` owns a `VeloEvents` that routes event operations (await, trigger,
poison) over active messages when the event belongs to a remote instance.

### How it works

Events carry a `system_id` identifying their owner instance. When an operation
targets a local event, it goes straight to `velo-events`. When it targets a
remote event, the messenger layer handles it:

1. **Subscribe** — instance B wants to await an event owned by A. B creates a
   local proxy event and sends an `_event_subscribe` AM to A. A records the
   subscription.
2. **Complete** — when A triggers (or poisons) the event, it sends
   `_event_trigger` AMs to all subscribers. B receives the completion and
   triggers its local proxy, waking all local awaiters.
3. **Caching** — completed remote events are moved into an LRU cache so
   repeated awaits on recently-finished events resolve immediately without
   hitting the network.

A 3-tier lookup keeps the fast path fast:

| Tier | Storage | When |
|------|---------|------|
| 1 | LRU cache | Event completed recently — instant response |
| 2 | Active DashMap | Another local task already subscribed — piggyback |
| 3 | Network | First subscriber — send `_event_subscribe` to owner |

### TOCTOU safety

The subscribe handler on the owner checks if the event is already completed
before recording the subscriber. If it has, it sends the completion immediately
so the subscriber never misses a trigger that raced with the subscription.

### Usage

```rust,no_run
// Events are available on every Messenger instance
let event = messenger.event_manager().new_event()?;
let handle = event.handle();

// Any instance that knows the handle can await it
let awaiter = other_messenger.event_manager().awaiter(handle)?;
event.trigger()?;
awaiter.await?;
```

## Features

| Feature | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `http`  | yes     | HTTP transport (via ``) |
| `grpc`  | yes     | gRPC transport |
| `nats`  | yes     | NATS transport |
| `ucx`   | no      | UCX transport (requires system libs) |

## Examples

See [`examples/ping_pong.rs`](examples/ping_pong.rs) for an end-to-end benchmark that creates two `Messenger` instances on separate runtimes and measures unary RTT over TCP.

```sh
cargo run -p velo-messenger --example ping_pong -- --rounds 5000
```

## Tests

Unit tests live alongside the source in each module. Run them with:

```sh
cargo test -p velo-messenger
```
