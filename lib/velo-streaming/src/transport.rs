//! Transport abstraction for frame-level ordered delivery.
//!
//! This module defines the [`FrameTransport`] trait boundary consumed by
//! [`crate::anchor::AnchorManager`] and implemented by
//! [`crate::velo_transport::VeloFrameTransport`].
//!
//! Transport endpoints are concrete [`flume::Receiver<Vec<u8>>`] and
//! [`flume::Sender<Vec<u8>>`] channel halves rather than trait objects.
//! This enables mixed sync/async usage: synchronous `send()` in Drop impls,
//! `send_async().await` on the normal data path, and `recv_async().await` in
//! the reader pump.

/// Transport abstraction for frame-level ordered delivery.
///
/// # Ordered-Delivery Contract
///
/// All frames -- including data frames (`Item`, `Heartbeat`) **and** sentinel
/// frames (`Dropped`, `Detached`, `Finalized`, `TransportError`) -- MUST travel
/// the **same physical channel** established by [`FrameTransport::bind`] /
/// [`FrameTransport::connect`]. Sentinels MUST NOT be injected via a side
/// channel; the FIFO ordering guarantee of the underlying channel is
/// load-bearing for the correctness of the streaming protocol.
///
/// Implementations MUST preserve send order: a frame sent before another MUST
/// be received before that other frame on the corresponding
/// [`flume::Receiver`].
///
/// # Usage
///
/// The transport operates at the raw byte level. Callers are responsible for
/// serializing [`crate::frame::StreamFrame`] values to `Vec<u8>` before
/// sending via [`flume::Sender::send_async`], and for deserializing bytes
/// received from [`flume::Receiver::recv_async`].
///
/// # Async Design
///
/// Both `bind` and `connect` return [`BoxFuture`] to support async
/// implementations (e.g., network setup). The heap allocation is acceptable
/// because these are setup-path calls, not per-frame hot-path operations.
pub trait FrameTransport: Send + Sync {
    /// Bind a new receive endpoint for the given anchor.
    ///
    /// Returns `(endpoint_address, receiver)` where `endpoint_address` is an
    /// opaque string the sender passes to [`connect`][FrameTransport::connect]
    /// and `receiver` is the receive half of the frame channel.
    ///
    /// - `anchor_id`: identifies which anchor this binding is for.
    /// - `session_id`: unique session identifier for this attachment; used by
    ///   the transport to discriminate between successive sessions on the same
    ///   anchor so that stale frames from a prior session are not delivered.
    ///
    /// The channel established by `bind` / `connect` MUST provide ordered,
    /// loss-free delivery of all frames including sentinels.

    /// - `endpoint`: the address string returned by a prior [`bind`][FrameTransport::bind] call.
    ///   **Implementations must convert this `&str` to an owned `String` before
    ///   entering the async block** (the future's lifetime is tied to `&self`,
    ///   not to `endpoint`).
    /// - `anchor_id`: identifies which anchor this writer is attached to.
    /// - `session_id`: unique session identifier for this attachment; used by
    ///   the transport to route frames to the correct reader.
